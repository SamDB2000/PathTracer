# PathTracer
Final Project for CS 434, Implementing bi-directional path tracing

Plan:


 Checkpoint 1:

    Goal: Extend raytracer with BVH and show that it can handle rays more efficiently. Also extend scene definition file to be more robust
    Deliverable: Sample scenes with compared render times

 

 

Checkpoint 2:

     Goal: Implement bi-directional path tracing with the phong model
    Deliverable: Cornell box with diffuse-diffuse reflection.

 

We expect to haves the tasks for Checkpoint 2 well underway by the time Checkpoint 1 hits, but we're not expecting it to be in any state to present
